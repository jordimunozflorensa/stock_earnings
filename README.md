Improvements/New_Funcionalities:
- implement a loading visualization via progress bar f.i.
- implement the same to track the dividends of stocks (in a way in which via a button I can include to the calendar the earnings and/or the dividends)
    - see if we want ex-dividend date or payment date (or both, chosing them via a button)
